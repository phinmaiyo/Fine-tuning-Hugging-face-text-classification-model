# Fine-Tuning RoBERTa Model for Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

This repository provides a guide and code for fine-tuning the RoBERTa model using the Hugging Face Transformers library for sentiment analysis tasks. RoBERTa, a robustly optimized BERT approach, serves as a powerful base model, and fine-tuning allows adaptation to domain-specific sentiment analysis datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
Prepare your sentiment analysis dataset in the required format. Ensure that it contains the necessary labels for sentiment classes.

## Fine-Tuning
Run the fine-tuning script to train the RoBERTa model on your dataset:
python fine_tune_roberta.py --train_data_path path/to/train_data.csv --valid_data_path path/to/valid_data.csv
Customize the script parameters according to your dataset and training requirements.

## Configuration
- Twitter_sentiment_analysis_model.ipynb: Main script for fine-tuning the RoBERTa model.
- requirements.txt: List of dependencies required for running the scripts.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate the fine-tuned model on the validation set to assess its performance:
python evaluate_model.py --model_path path/to/fine_tuned_model

## Results
Document the results of the model evaluation, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Model Deployment
Once satisfied with the fine-tuned model's performance, deploy it for inference in your desired environment.
